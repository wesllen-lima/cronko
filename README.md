## What it is

Cronko monitors cron jobs, backup scripts, ETL pipelines, and any scheduled
automation that can fire an HTTP request. You configure a monitor with an
expected interval, receive a ping URL, and the system alerts you when a job
misses its window.

It is not an observability platform. It does not collect metrics, parse logs,
or do distributed tracing. If you need Datadog, this is not it. Cronko does
one thing: it tells you when your jobs stop running.

## How it works

Each monitor gets a unique ping URL. Your cron job hits that URL when it runs.
The scheduler checks every few seconds whether each monitor received a heartbeat
within its expected window. Late heartbeats trigger a miss, prolonged absence
triggers a down status, and recovery resets everything. Incidents are tracked
with start/end timestamps. Notifications fire on every state transition through
Discord, Telegram, Email, or Slack.

```bash
# in your crontab
0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/backup.sh && \
  curl -s https://cronko.example.com/ping/your-token > /dev/null
```

## Features

- Heartbeat monitoring for cron jobs, scripts, ETLs
- Status detection: pending → healthy → missed → down → recovered
- Configurable grace periods before marking as missed
- Incident tracking with timestamps for every status transition
- Pulse (start/finish) for precise duration measurement of long-running jobs
- Max duration alerts when jobs exceed configured limits
- Notifications via Discord, Telegram, Email, Slack
- Public SVG status badge (`/badge/:token`) without authentication
- Dashboard with donut chart, sparklines, animated counters, 24h uptime
- Automatic heartbeat cleanup (configurable retention)
- Dark / Light / System theme with animated View Transition API
- Compact mode for smaller screens
- CSV export for heartbeat data
- i18n: English and Portuguese (Brazil)
- SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production
- Redis for distributed rate limiting (optional)
- Docker and local dev support
- Health probes: `/health`, `/health/live`, `/health/ready`
- Scheduler metrics: `/health/metrics`
- Audit logging for all critical actions
- Database backup and restore scripts
- Refresh token rotation with automatic renewal

## Installation

### Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wesllen-lima/cronko
cd cronko
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env — set JWT_SECRET, ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_PASSWORD
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` and log in with `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

### Local development

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
# DATABASE_URL defaults to SQLite — no additional setup needed
pnpm dev
```

API runs on `:3001`, web on `:3000`.

## Notification integrations

### Discord
Create a webhook in your Discord server settings. Add a channel in Cronko with
type `discord` and paste the webhook URL.
```json
{ "webhookUrl": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..." }
```

### Telegram
Create a bot via `@BotFather`, get the token, find your chat ID. Add a channel
with type `telegram`.
```json
{ "botToken": "123456:ABC-DEF...", "chatId": "-1001234567890" }
```

### Email
Set `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, and `SMTP_FROM` in
`.env`. Add a channel with type `email` and the recipient address.
```json
{ "to": "alerts@example.com" }
```

### Slack
Create a Slack webhook. Add a channel with type `slack` and paste the webhook URL.
```json
{ "webhookUrl": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/..." }
```

## Advanced features

### Pulse (start/finish)
For long-running jobs, use `/start` before starting and `/finish` when done.
Duration is calculated automatically.
```bash
curl -X POST https://cronko.example.com/ping/TOKEN/start
./my-long-job.sh
curl -X POST "https://cronko.example.com/ping/TOKEN/finish?d=$SECONDS&exit=$?"
```

### Public status badge
Display your monitor's status anywhere with a public SVG badge.
```markdown
![Cronko](https://cronko.example.com/badge/TOKEN)
```

### Max duration
Set a max duration limit when creating a monitor. If a ping reports a duration
above this limit, an incident is automatically generated.

### Heartbeat cleanup
Heartbeats older than 90 days are automatically removed (configurable in
Settings).

### CSV export
Export any monitor's heartbeats as CSV:
`/api/monitors/:id/heartbeats?format=csv`
